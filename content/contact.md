## Contact Details

> **Note:** This is the best way to reach me. Reach-ability lowers from top to bottom. For example, Signal and Matrix are the fastest ways to reach me, while Telegram is the slowest way.

> **Note:** Please note these telephone numbers do not work with SMS/Calling, so you have to use them for Signal/Telegram, respectively. I may set up a business IP Phone in the near future. Until then, anyone who does not want to use any of these other platforms can email me.

> **Warning:** I prefer not to be contacted over Telegram, unless it's a last resort. I may not be able to know you contacted me in a timely fashion because Telegram has some problems at the moment.

## Socials & Community

> **Note:** Join me on my socials to get updates and also engage with the community. Although if you want to reach me directly (not interact with my posts or the community in general), it's far easier and better to contact me from the details above.
